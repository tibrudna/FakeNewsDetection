# Fake News Detection System
This project is a course project for my bachelor's degree.

## Abstract
Fake news are becoming a highly relevant topic in modern society,
as the spread of false information is on the rise.
To answer thequestion “Can a text analyzing system reliably detect fake news?”,
we used a machine learning model In order to achieve this, we explored different methods for natural language processing to extract
characteristics of fake and real news articles. These characteristics
can then be used to differentiate between the two. With these features we built a machine learning model which is able to classify
whether a given news article is real or fake.
